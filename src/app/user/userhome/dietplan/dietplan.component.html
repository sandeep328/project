      <h4>Carbs are the body’s main source of energy and should make up half of your daily calorie requirement. However, it’s important to choose the right type of carbs.

        For example, simple carbs, such as bread, biscuit, white rice, and wheat flour, contain too much sugar and are bad for you. Instead, opt for complex carbs that are high in fiber and packed with nutrients as compared to simple carbs.</h4>

            Most Indians fail to meet their daily protein requirement. This is troublesome, as proteins are essential to help the body build and repair tissue, muscles, cartilage, and skin, as well as to pump your blood. Hence, a high protein diet can also help you lose weight, as it helps build muscle – which burns more calories than fat.

            Vegetarians eliminate meat and sometimes other animal foods, while vegans avoid meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and all other animal-derived food products.

            Because flexitarians eat animal products, they’re not considered vegetarians or vegans.
            
            The Flexitarian Diet has no clear-cut rules or recommended numbers of calories and macronutrients. In fact, it’s more of a lifestyle than a diet.</h4>
